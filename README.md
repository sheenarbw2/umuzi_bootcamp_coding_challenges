# How to submit your code callenges

1. Save your code on your computer
   Make a new folder/directory and save your answers in there. Use a text editor or a code editor. DO NOT usea wrd processor to save your source code.
   We dont care too much how you cave them, so long as you know how to demonstrate your answers it's fine. If If you want to make multiple files then do that
   If you want to make one file then do that
   If you want to make multiple sub-directories then do that
   etc

2. Create a github user account

   1. go to https://github.com
   2. create a "free" account.

3. Create public repo on github

   1. on the left hand side of the page there is a "Create a repository" link. click on it
   2. give your repo a name. For example "umuzi_bootcamp_coding_challenges"
   3. make sure "public" is selected
   4. submit the form
   5. you should see a whole bunch of funny looking commands and headings that probably dont make sense

4. Upload your answers
   Underneath the heading "Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before" find the link that says "uploading an existing file". Click on it.
   Drag and drop your files into the browser.

5. Find a manager to talk to

   When you are done then come talk to one of the managers/facilitators (except Dibwe, he is busy). If we are unavailable becasue we are busy with a student then please wait.
