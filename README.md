# How to submit your code callenges

1. Save your code on your computer
   We dont care too muchhow you cave them, so long as you know how to demonstrate your answers it's fine. If If you want tomakemultiple files then do that
   If you want to make one file then do that
   If you want to make multiple directories then do that
   etc

2. make sure "git" is installed on your computer. You can find instructions here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git

3. Now open up a terminal on your computer and `cd` into the directory where you saved your files.
   If this step makes absolutely no sense then please visit: http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=91tih1fq76g and go through the tutorial up until the end of step 5

4. Make sure you are in the right place:
   if you type `ls` in your terminal then you should see all your files

5. Create a github user account

   1. go to https://github.com

   3. make sure "public" is selected
   4. submit the form

   You should now see a bunch of headings and funny looking commands. Look for the title that says "â€¦or create a new repository on the command line". Copy
